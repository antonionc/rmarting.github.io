[Cheat Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet) :bookmark: are concises set of notes :pencil:
used for a quick reference. Many enterprise products, community projects and systems provide them to help and
facilitate the life of the users :couple:.

and products used in my daily labor. I shared here for anyone needs a quick reference of some
of the following items:
