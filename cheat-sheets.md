[Cheat Sheets](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheat_sheet) :bookmark: are concises set of notes :pencil:
used for a quick reference. Many enterprise products, community projects and systems provide them to help and
facilitate the life of the users :couple:.

After many time working with some projects, I created my own cheet sheets for different projects
or products used in my daily labor. I shared here for anyone needs a quick reference of some
of the following items:

* [ActiveMQ Artemis Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/activemq-artemis)
* [Apache Kafka Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/apache-kafka)
* [Strimzi Cheat Sheet](/cheat-sheets/strimzi)

I hope :pray: you could find them usefull. Feel free to use or improve the
following my [contribution guide](/contributing).
