As much as learn about [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) I realized that it is an amazing
tool for wrinting blogs, personal sites, communities or whatever other space in Internet. 
Simple things as scheduling is so easy. :dizzy:

When you are posting blogs sometimes you need that your content not should be published
before a specific date. I have been using CMS as [Joomla](https://www.joomla.org/),
[Wordpress](https://www.wordpress.com/), [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/) several times
and scheduling is an important feature in all of them. Jekyll do the same but with
a very simple mechanism.

Every post page has a *metadata* area similar to:

```yaml
---
layout: post
title:  ":calendar: How to schedule posts in GitHup Pages"
date:   2020-09-27 12:00
```

Here the :bulb: is provided by the **date** attribute. Basically you only need to
set up the right moment to be online your post. Choose your date :calendar:, and
optionally your time :watch:. That is! 

Pretty cool !!! :cool::sunglasses:

Happy posting!! :pencil2: :books: !!!
